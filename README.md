-DRONE TECHNOLOGY-

When it comes to natural disasters, there are loads of them, and the threat they pose is real.
Although a generic solution can't be applied to prevent, predict or manage the impact of all natural disasters,
lets look at the specific case of FLOODS which is one of the most common natural disasters in India.

When it comes to floods there are many preventive and predecitve measures, these are applied at different levels.
Predective wheather analysis, the adequate control of dams, keeing a check on the flow of rivers, etc. can all be applied to effectively  predict and try to prevent the situation.
But the real problem lies in the managment of the impact, the problems faced during the incidient and how to tackle it.

-Proposed Technology
  The main pain point during a flood is being stranded in your homes with no access to resources to survive. 
  No mode of transportation really functions well in that situation.
  Light weight drones can easily capture footage of the scene with no human risk at all. 
  Using these footage, stranded people can be easily spotted.
  A more heavy duty drones can now be used to fly in with resources like clean water medicine etc to these people very effectively
  Even communication can be established.
  Using facial recogniton algorithms, these drones can keep a record of all the people in danger,for corncered friends and family to look up as well.

Areas prone to floods can be supplied with these custom Rescue Drones for immediate retaliation against the natural disaster and possibly save hundereds of lives. The Drone market is increasing and cost effective drones can be easily built and programmed with incredible software. This can play a crucial role in saving flood victims.

So the end plan is to build  custom drone with the required harware{cost effective chasis material, a good camera} , and good face recognition software to work on,  along with other intelligent navigation and flight algorithms.
